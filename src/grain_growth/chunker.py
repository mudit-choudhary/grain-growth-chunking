"""Grain-Growth Chunking — next-fit packing under structural barriers.

A chunk grows by accepting the next block whole and keeps growing until either
the size budget is reached or it meets a barrier: a section heading, or a block
that must stand alone such as a table. Barriers are absolute — a chunk never
crosses one, however much budget is left.

The packing is *next-fit* in the bin-packing sense, not first-fit or best-fit:
when a block will not fit the chunk being grown, that chunk is closed for good
and a new one opens, and no earlier chunk is ever reopened to see whether the
block would have fitted there. One pass, in order, which is what keeps reading
order intact.

In the published taxonomy this is document-based / structure-aware chunking;
the closest existing implementation is Unstructured's `by_title` chunker.

Consumes the ordered, typed blocks produced by txt_processor.py
(title / section / paragraph / list / caption / table / formula / footnote /
authors) and produces chunks that respect the document's structure:

- headings never form their own chunk; the heading path is prefixed to each
  chunk's embedded text and stored as metadata
- whole paragraphs are packed into a chunk up to `target_chars`; only a
  paragraph that alone exceeds `max_chars` is split, at sentence boundaries,
  with a one-sentence overlap between pieces
- captions and tables are standalone chunks; a caption adjacent to a table
  travels with it
- formulas are packed inline with the surrounding prose (bare equation
  numbers are dropped)
- list blocks split at item boundaries and are packed like paragraphs
- authors and footnotes are excluded from embedding (returned as `skipped`)

This module is deliberately free of config/chromadb imports so it can be
unit-tested and used by scripts/rag_inspect.py without side effects.

# Two behaviours, because the distinction is real rather than cosmetic: a
# formula is fenced but stays packed with the prose that explains it, while a
# table is fenced and stands alone. Adding a type to either set is the whole
# change needed — `list` is deliberately in neither, because a bibliography is
